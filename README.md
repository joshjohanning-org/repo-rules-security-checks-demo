# repo-rules-security-checks-demo
demo of using repo rules to enforce seurity checks

## How This Works

To ensure security scans are ran, you can use a combination of: 
1. Reusable Workflows
2. Repository Rulesets, and 
3. Required Status Checks (with the name of the job in the reusable workflow like `security-checks / security-checks`)

- To ensure certain workflows arenâ€™t updated, use the Codeowners file
Example: compliance-*.yml workflows are owned by the security team


## Notes

- Use this script to push workflow to selected repositories https://github.com/joshjohanning/github-misc-scripts/blob/main/gh-cli/add-workflow-file-to-repositories.sh
